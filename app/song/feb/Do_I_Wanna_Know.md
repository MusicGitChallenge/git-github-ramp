1. Sonically, the song has a similar guitar riff to the Arctic Monkeys' "R U Mine?" single but is more down tempo. The neo-psychedelia, stoner Rock groove is reminiscent of the Josh Homme-produced tracks on their Humbug album.
2. The song debuted at #11 on the UK singles chart, the band's best placing since "Fluorescent Adolescent" peaked at #5 in 2007.
