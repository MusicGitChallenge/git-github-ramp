# SongFacts

1. Lennon wrote this song as an ode to his wife Yoko Ono. He regarded it as the most Beatles-like track on his Double Fantasy album and he called it the '80s update of "Girl," which is a track on Rubber Soul.
2. Speaking with Rolling Stone just days before his death, Lennon said: "'Woman' came about because, one sunny afternoon in Bermuda, it suddenly hit me what women do for us. Not just what my Yoko does for me, although I was thinking in those personal terms... but any truth is universal. What dawned on me was everything I was taking for granted. Women really are the other half of the sky, as I whisper at the beginning of the song. It's a 'we' or it ain't anything."
3. This was released as a single in January 1981, about a month after Lennon was murdered.
